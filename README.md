# Flick Cafe
- Flick Cafe is a modern coffee shop/movie house with a 1920s art deco vintage twist, located in Burnaby.
It is a concept 3 of us came up with in the first term of this program. The website will allow users to
order ahead for pickup (featuring a checkout page process and cart page), as well as browse the week’s
current screenings that will be shown in-house. The homepage will introduce the cafe’s atmosphere,
with sections highlighting the menu, interior and overall vibes. The site will also include a contact page
for users to submit ideas or feedback. Potential features could include polls allowing users to vote for
upcoming screenings, user sign in and user reviews.
